# About

Wikilibs is a web toy that makes fill-in-the-blank games out of Wikipedia articles. It's built using React and TypeScript and is powered by the MediaWiki API. I developed Wikilibs just to get some frontend practice outside of my day job.

# Usage
This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app and can be ran locally with `npm start`. Production builds can be made with `npm build`.
